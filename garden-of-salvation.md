# Garden of Salvation

The Garden of Salvation entry point is located on the Moon map. The very beginning of the raid is accessible from patrol, but the raid itself is not.

## Encounter 1: Evade the Consecrated Mind – Embrace

The first encounter in the Garden of Salvation has players evade the Consecrated Mind. To do this, teams split into two in order to open doors and collect Voltaic Overflow. The end of the section is a mad dash through an open field.

Create a tether chain to the Vex barrier to start encounter.

One group pushes to next barrier, killing the Angelic and tethering the door open.

Other group stays near Consecrated Mind, collecting its Voltaic Overflow.

When Consecrated Mind moves, the back team leapfrogs over the forward team into the new area.

Continue leapfrogging, collecting Voltaic Overflow and tethering the Vex barrier open.
When in the open field, collect Voltaic Overflow and fight to the other side to end the encounter.

### Encounter Mechanics

**Voltaic Overflow** – The Consecrated Mind will create a Voltaic Overflow every 60 seconds or so. Unless picked up, it will explode and kill the team. A player who picks it up will receive a 2 minute 30 second timer. Collecting another one while this timer is still going will kill the player.

**Angelic** – A special type of Hydra that must be killed to unlock the box, allowing players to use it to tether open a door.

**Tethering** – Standing near an unlocked Vex box and shooting it creates a tether, which links between all nearby players. This is used to unlock the locks on the Vex barriers.

**Overload Minotaurs** – Giant Minotaurs that can only be dealt significant damage when disrupted using Overload Bullets.

### In-Depth Explanation

The Party should split into two Squads of 3. All members should be sure to have an **OVERLOAD** weapon (Machineguns and Bows), and be suited up for addclear.

Squad A pushes forward and attacks the first Vex Gate, Killing the **Angelic** Hydra and **OVERLOAD** Minotaur.

Meanwhile, Squad B deals with all adds, and obtains Voltaic Overflows from the boss.

Once Squad A has unlocked the gate, Squad B rushes ahead to the second gate, and kills  the **Angelic** and the **OVERLOAD**, while Squad A kills adds and obtains the Overflow.
Alternate like this until the final gate is reached, where there will be **THREE** of each **OVERLOAD** and **ANGELIC**.

After the Final Gate is opened, it is a mad focused dash to the end. Only one player needs to reach the end, but EVERYONE needs to kill the several **OVERLOAD** Minotaurs and the Cyclops, while still collecting the Voltaic Overflow.
